                                <b class="mb-4">FEN NI</b>
                                <p class="mb-4">Niann tsyr didnt recognise her girlfriend ouch. Niann tsyr busy thinking about her gpa even when she halfway through lying on my airport. 
                                    We went to suntec and were like lost goats, niann tsyr so jie jie help me ask around. Niann tsyr was being a jie jie the whole time when she helped me 
                                    asked everything and fill in the model info. We went into green party and niann tsyr was tempted by her denial adhd. She was busy popping.
                                    We went to sky garden to chill. Niann tsyr kissing demon. I liked her passionate kisses even tho i still a stick. I crave for more. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Niann tsyr is not heavy. I liked when she sat on me. When she sat on me backwards, i found another tickle spot heheIt wasnt intentional, 
                                    i was just resting my head. But after that it was intentional until i rested my head for quite long. I quite like resting in that position. I could fall 
                                    asleep. I tried not to move much so that my girlfriend is not tickled. I let my cutie lie on my airport, i didnt mind it actually, and i liked it. Shes cute.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I want to stay at the rooftop hugging niann tsyr forever but we stayed quite long. When we passionate kiss, a uncle decide to stand there watch free show oof what a light bulb
                                    <br><br>
                                    When we were leaving the garden, niann tsyr's psycho thoughts started. She tried to strangle me. She said better stay away from her, so i did and walked behind her. 
                                    When we were going off, 2 of us lost monkeys trying to find the mrt. We decide to take the bus and oof the mrt was just on the right. But at least i got to hug niann tsyr more.
                                    <br><br>
                                    When we were in the mrt otw to nex, cutie decide to be naughty, keep leaning on my tickle spots. I like it, but it'll be nicer if its in a private place.
                                    I didnt want to shift but it was ticklish. But in the end i still let her lean tho there was some point it was quite ticklish.
                                    She began rubbing /tickling my ear very gently while using her phone. I enjoyed it. But she suddenly got rough with it. Tsk tsk
                                    <br><br>
                                    When we were at nex, my girlfriend went to buy contacts solution while i busy hunting my friend and her date. Fun fun heh
                                    <br>
                                    We met my friend and i got nth to say so i just bye immediately after saying hi HAHAHA
                                    <br>
                                    Then we went to colins. Niann tsyr was busy koala and she sneaky. Kept tickling my neck. Again, i like it but i would like it more if we're in a private place. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    When we were near finishing, niann tsyr began hiding in a corner after being so affectionate. She looked like she was going through a 'stay away from me' moment. 
                                    Its seemed like shes the kind that needs alot of me time after being affectionate
                                    <br><br>
                                    So i randomly called her asexual. Cause she seem to distance herself away feom being affectionate. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Afterwards we were parting, cutie niann tsyr was so sad, me too hurh hurh. I wish i can spend the whole day with my cutie without being worrying about the time ü•∫
                                    <br>
                                    My gentleman girlfriend sent me to the mrt again. ‚ù§Ô∏è
                                    </p>


                                
                                <p class="mb-4">NIANN</p>
                                <p class="mb-4">Ooo Fen ni picked me up, I didn't see her until she came closer to me. In my defence, I didn't expect her to reach alr.
                                    Then we went to bishan to have our breakfast. Oh ya I still haven't paid for my food. I regret buying a set, well nvm about that. Fen Ni occasionally looked at me, 
                                    and I felt self conscious.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Then we headed off to suntec
                                    We were all good till we entered suntec city then we didn't know where the shop was. I asked the customer service which I should've done earlier and save us the trouble. 
                                    It was funny cause we called the company, but they were literally beside us. Hahaha. We waited on the chair for the people infront of us to be done. I had to help Fen Ni 
                                    with the driver details, which reasonable for her to be unfamiliar with. I'm glad I went with her, I doubt she would have been comfortable going here on her own.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Then we went window shopping. Omg I finally bought the ribbon I wanted, idk if it was impulsive but I bought it anyways. its so pretty, Kinda. I'll just look more girly, 
                                    but doesn't matter anyways around fen ni i dress more girly. (Or I attempt to). There were many other shop that sold nice clothes, I saw the button shirt at (a god damn 
                                    it I forgot the shop name), anyways wow it was the shirt I wanted. I'm going to get it, Black button shirt is so much sexier than white. Not important anyways.  We held 
                                    each others waist very often and hugged on the escalator which I really liked. (later at sky garden does she tell me I'm actually lying on her airport) for now i had not clue.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Ya da ya da ya da, i can't remember what we did but we took forever to find sky garden till my chopstick legs were tired. But! We eventually found it, damn it why can't they just open the entrance.
                                    We found a place to just chill, and my hair made me sweat faster than my wool? shirt and long pants which I didnt even sweat in. Perks of long hair, oh well, my beloved likes me in long 
                                    hair, so I'll like it too. Somehow, Fen Ni became a little Kissing Demon, i think it started with her sitting on me? Not sure, anyways when Fen Ni kisses me,  it still makes me go 
                                    giddy and I lose track of my surroundings. It is no exaggeration to say she intoxicates me. Well then, we were busy being affectionate to one another. Now then she told me I was lying on her 
                                    air port, and I didn't realise it. I mean, not that she was super flat, well kinda, i just thought that I was slightly above that area. And as a nice girl I was, I avoided leaning there. 
                                    (I didn't know that on the escalator I was also lying on her airport, until I read journal) And god damn it she found another place that tickles me and I doubt she'll let me off.  Then we 
                                    decided to go off, but idk why suddenly I got the urge to use violence. Okay it wasn't sudden, it was cause when she tickled me, my natural response was to like hm how to phrase it nicely... 
                                    Eliminate the source? basically fight response
                                    <br><br>
                                    So oops, poor Fen Ni was busy walking behind me after that and held my hand so I wouldn't you know, jab her or hug her very tightly. We had to find the MRT which we couldn't we ended up 
                                    taking a bus just to realise a few meters ahead was the mrt stop. Omg. Oh ya, now Fen Ni also uses violence. Goodie goodie.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Then we were otw to serangoon and her friend was on a blind date. The guy was kinda ugly, I mean, on tik tok yes he is good looking. but in person which I saw later, it was disappointing.  Then we bought what 
                                    I needed then we went on amazing race to find B1-27 hahaha. We saw them and yes. anyways we then went to collins to eat and I was basically being a koala cause I didn't want to part with Fen Ni.
                                    Then I went to distrub her while she was drinking her soup, not intentionally tickle. I just wanted to bonk her with my head. then she said either maskless or don't do. So I didn't do, cause I'm a 
                                    shy teddy. uh then food came and I still didn't let her off, I would eat chew then nudge and repeat.
                                    <br><br>
