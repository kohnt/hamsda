This is our never ending diary, to our love and its many years to come.

To my chickpea:
I love you a lot, more than words could ever express it. I enjoy the laughter we exchange, 
the times where we just exchange judgmental looks randomly,
run to catch a buses and get lost figuring out a bus stop's location,
and the slowed quiet moments where we share a personal space.

Daunting moments that tempered our relationship are equally loving as the good times-
times where you were patient during times I couldn't be,
others where I reassured you on nights where the distance made us feel alone and lonely,
and times we talked honestly and vented all residual anger and grudge.

When I'm 21 I want to celebrate out next step in life with you
when I'm 25 I want to drink to my first job
whenever we're ready, I want to (交杯酒) interlock arms and drink our wedding wine
when I'm 35 I'll look into your eyes just the way I do now.
when I'm....
you get the idea, its a long list of love

Cheers to our love, and monopolizing you for 3 lives and 3 lives more.
