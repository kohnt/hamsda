                                <p class="mb-4">I wanted to scare you when I realized you were standing by the stairs but as I got on the escalator, you decided to turn your head suddenly.
                                    It was raining, so I had thought about using my umbrella for both of us but then you took out yours too. In the end, both of us use our own. 
                                    Oof what a waste to the romantic moment it could have become.</p>

                                <p class="mb-4"><b>During Ice Skating</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-4">At the start, I was scared of falling on the ice so I decided to hold on to you for dear life. 
                                    I felt a little guilty and I was worried you’d be bored, so I asked you to go skate on your own so that you could enjoy.</p>

                                <p class="mb-4"><b>After Ice Skating</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-4">My hand and arms for some reason are hurting instead of my legs hahaha (I remembered we played basketball at arcade before Ice skating).
                                    I was sleepy after ice skating, so I didn’t really got to enjoy my food. But, I enjoyed the view that was in front of me. I would go ice skating with you (only) again.</p>
                                
                                <p class="mb-4"><b>Otw Home</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-4">When we were walking to the mrt, you linked arms with me. I wanted to hold your hand so I kept asking why women like to hold their handbag in a certain way, 
                                    like won’t their hands get tired. But you ended up getting the wrong idea, got offended and let go of my hand. Oops. Then I felt bad and sad at the same time haha cause 
                                    I wanted to hold your hand. So to make up for that, I decided to hold your hand at buona cause you looked upset. And then you blushed. Hehhe. What a cutie. 
                                    Then I offered you my shoulder in the mrt cause you said you were tired. I didn’t really put much thought before I offered my shoulder, it just simply got out of my mouth. 
                                    You had the honour of being the first one.
                                </p>

                                <p class="mb-4"><b>Waiting for you to meeting you</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-4">That was fun, I never thought of doing that, we played the basketball one which was a first for me, ah your arms are weak getting tired after that little bit of throwing. 
                                    You drive well, but I did pick a lower horsepowered car so blehh. It was fun trying to go backwards, I still don’t think I accomplished that. 
                                    It felt like you pushed me more, like a bulldozer. You were busy dancing like octopus, I see why your arms would hurt.
                                </p>

                                <p class="mb-4"><b>Ice skating</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-4">I'm glad you let me skate a few rounds on my own and were independent at times. I did enjoy spending the time with you, and doing stupid things and trying new things, like going backwards. 
                                    Even if I knew how to skate I was still learning new things together with you. I had to support your weight when you lost balance and was worrying you would fall. 
                                    Idk if you would feel embarrassed so I was hell bent on not letting you fall. Plus I didn't want you to hurt yourself. You are a fast learner, and we managed to skate quite a fast speed together 
                                    so that made me happy. I kept my hands to myself till you were on ice. Oh ya, I helped you put on your skates. That was fun, being able to help you even if it was a tiny thing.
                                </p>

                                <p class="mb-4"><b>Lunch</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-4">
                                    Well from lunch onward, there wasn't much. Cause I was in a daze alr at that time. Can't believe it was 4pm so quickly.
                                </p>

                                <p class="mb-4"><b>Mrt</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-4">I like how you leant into my when we walked, even if it made walking difficult, it was a happy problem. Then we even linked arms, I didn't even consider that there could be people looking at us, 
                                    I was too absorbed in just being with you. Then the mrt you offered me your shoulder. So that was happy for me.
