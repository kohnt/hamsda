                                <p class="mb-4">FEN NI</p>
                                <p class="mb-4">I don’t know how, I was sitting on Niann Tsyr’s chair and then somehow ended up on her bed, we tickled each other and we ended up cuddling.
                                    Niann tsyr heart beat very fast, I enjoyed cuddling and Niann Tsyr there randomly touching my ear. I didn’t dare to place my hands anywhere, I don’t want to risk getting slapped.
                                    You turned me into a simp when you played Endless Love on the piano. I like it alot, I was genuinely in love when u played that song for me
                                </p>

                                
                                <p class="mb-4">NIANN</p>
                                <p class="mb-4"><b>Waterway Point</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-4">Buying food for my family was scary. I can't believe I spent so long outside, actually I was alr tired after the travelling. I just had to keep my energy level up longer till 4pm</p>
                                
                                <p class="mb-4"><b>Home</b></p>
                                <p class="mb-4">I was glad when we started to lie down, cause at least it was resting. And being outside really drains my energy quickly. I wanted to play a song but it was loud and you didn't seem 
                                    interested in loud songs and I was tired and had no energy and mood to play the piano. I'm glad you took the guitar cause I didn't have to think I could just look at you.</p>
                                <p>That song what are words, is a song I really loved, only cause he became asshole which ruined it. But the song's original meaning didn't change. 
                                    I really loved seeing you play the guitar.</p>
                                <p>And I think I'd rather you lie on me instead of the other way round. In terms of height and build, I'm taller and have broader shoulders than you. 
                                    So yes, I'll hug you from the back instead of the other way round. I enjoyed cuddling a lot. I'm a very touchy person and I really like cuddles and hugs so yes definitely. 
                                    You are small idk why but even though our weight is similar you seem so small.</p>
                                <p>I like when you were on my bed and you almost put your head on my shoulder while I was picking clothes.
                                    I was shy when you were lying on my chest. My heart was going to jump out of my chest already. I realized you are so flat, I forgot about being conscious of where to put my hands at times.
                                    My nai nai forced us to take photo together. I'm surprised our first picture tgt was forced.</p>   
                                <p> Fen ni was not awkward today. I had fun today. You messed up my bed that's for sure. We literally rolled around and sat on the bed. And when you busy trying to not die from being 
                                    tickled you messed it up too. But at least it was just the bed, the rest of my room was messy enough hurh hurh. 
                                    I can’t really play pop songs so I doubt I was any good on the piano today. I'm not confident to play infront of others. No matter how many times I practiced that song it never came 
                                    out the exact way when I play it for you. I'm not confident yet, I feel you'll judge. I'll make sure I get comfortable with playing the piano for you, 
                                    I really want to serenade you with a repertoire of pieces.</p>   
                                <p>I think you suit being the little spoon.
                                    I’m curious whether you’re ticklish because I've yet to find an effective spot.
                                    You wouldn't wear anything inside my wardrobe</p>
