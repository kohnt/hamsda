                                <b class="mb-4">FEN NI</b>
                                <p class="mb-4">I help my cutie put nail polish and it went boom chao da 
                                    <br><br>
                                    She broke her parent's fan. Tsk tsk and this eee girl panicked and asked her brother for help
                                    <br><br>
                                    Her nai nai was so professional while my cutie busy moving her finger 
                                    <br><br>
                                    She called her hand dog and told me to wipe away the nail polish her nai nai put for her. I couldnt clean her nails cleanly, left some stains oops
                                    <br><br>
                                    We cuddled and kiss as usual. I wanted to remove my earring and this cutie decides to disturb me tsk tsk. She was too cute i couldn't resist
                                    <br><br>
                                    My cutie is extra ticklish today                                    
                                    My cutie decides to disturb me for revenge, she was having fun while fen ni was holding her ticklishness but failed quite badly today. Fen ni decide to revenge and put my cutie hand on my airport                                    
                                    This cutie freezes everytime i puts her hand there. Eventually i started to put her hand underneath my shirt, starting with my tummy so that my cutie gets used to it but cutie was shy and keeps avoiding
                                    <br><br>
                                    Then i decide to become naughtier, i put my girlfriend's hand on my boob. She was such a cutie, having existence crisis, frozed. She didn't dare to move her hand at all. 
                                    When we kissed, she tried to escape but fen ni keeps putting her hand back
                                    <br><br>
                                    Then my cutie offered me to put my hands on her airport. Im surprised she didn't mind at all but i am worried she feels invaded. After confirming a few times, fen ni put her hand on her boobs.
                                    <br><br>
                                    *deletes crude descriptions*
                                    <br><br>
                                    My cutie girlfriend was surprising unaware of her body and say shes more ticklish on her neck. She didn't know wat fen ni was doing and took a while to process, cutie. 
                                    She was so shy when fen ni asks her to attempt.
                                    After that, my fast learner cutie was fidgeting with my joystick. It felt good, i love it.
                                    My cutie loves me so much she was worried my airport felt neglectedü•∫
                                    <br><br>
                                    I think my cutie is comfortable with touching my boobs already? Im proud of her hehe
                                    <br><br>
                                    then we ate and went to sleep 
                                    <br><br>
                                    My cutie suddenly jerked her body while we were sleeping halfway. Ngl i was shocked. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    After that, i had to leave. My cutie looks so sad hurh hurh. When she took of her clothes to put on her bra, fen ni naughty hands, hugged her from behind. Fen ni was shy to look at her shirtless though. But my cutie is very cute. I really liked the skin to skin contact. I could stay there whole day but hurh hurh fen ni had to leave and my cutie might feel cold. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Then my cutie sent me to the bus stop and we parted hurh hurh
                                    </p>


                                
                                <p class="mb-4">NIANN</p>
                                <p class="mb-4">I was slightly slow in picking fen ni up. 2nd time already. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Fen ni was so focused on painting my nail. She went to hunt for the nail polish, I had a feeling it won't go well. 
                                    I broke the fan, I... In shocked, my grim reaper finger striked again. Then we move to the living room where fen ni tried 
                                    painting my nail, well, could've gone better. Then nai nai came to help then I disturb Nai nai with my finger twitching. 
                                    I decided better not to put, cause very weird.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Well then we went back and cuddled, cuddling was nice as usual, I really like having my girlfriend in my embrace.
                                    <br><br>
                                    She was going to remove her earring and I decided that I'm going to stop her just for fun. Heh.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Idk which part of our cuddling her mum called, just to check if she got covid. Oof. I didn't want my girlfriend to feel sad, 
                                    so I need cuddle more and give her more love. ‚ù§Ô∏è
                                    <br><br>
                                    Then oof my girlfriend's hand start to get naughty. Idk how we got there, but uh ya she ended up putting my hand underneath her shirt after much physical persuasion.
                                    Well I still didn't know what to do, so I just left my hand there, but when I kiss or turn I need to move which I didn't really want to cause um if it hasn't 
                                    been obvious enough, my girlfriend's boob was in my hand.
                                    Uh then my girlfriend, decided to continue teasing me. I really didn't know what to do, and I decided to just let fen ni touch mine. At least 
                                    I won't feel so awkward cause, dude what am I supposed to doooooo??? My girlfriend was already so open with me, I didn't see why I should be.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Then she asked for permission and slid her hand under my shirt then bra. My neck was still more ticklish tho. And well I don't know what to feel when she touches my boobs.
                                    Well I don't look at my own boob, so I have no clue what they really look like, I think fen ni was a little surprised. 
                                    Uh I was shy and all to try whatever she did and I was very unfamiliar with it. My girlfriend very patient as always. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Well I didn't know if I did it right or not. 
                                    Then we ate
                                    Heh and then I just laid with my girlfriend in bed, I like hugging her. I wish I could sleep with her in my arms every night. I had no clue I jerked in my sleep.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Then I auto woke up and cuddled fen ni a bit more before she had to leave, reluctantly, very very reluctantly, let her go. 
                                    The I wanted to put on my bra but she looked like she was going to open the door cause she wanted to go to the toilet. So I was waiting for her to open the door and leave otherwise later someone walk past. 
                                    She thought it was cause I was shy, which I mean I am shy. I would turn around then remove my shirt. 
                                    My girlfriend very koala, she hugged my from my back, I liked it. Then she got naughty and used her hand to cover my Changi airport. I think I'll get very bad withdrawal symptoms.
                                    My girlfriend very caring, worried I will get cold so asked me to get dressed, and then I sent her out. I didn't want her to miss the bus so I checked the timing so she would reach there just nice. Otherwise she might feel hot.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I miss my girlfriend so much the moment she left
                                </p>
