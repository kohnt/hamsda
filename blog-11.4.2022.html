                                <b class="mb-4">NIANN</b>
                                <p class="mb-4">I woke up and immediately saw my girlfriend. I was so amazed and happy to wake up and immediately see her. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èThe best way to wake up. Immediately the sleep went away, kinda. üòÇ
                                    <br>
                                    The traveling was wow. 
                                    I am amazed at the travel duration and the bus route. Maybe fen ni shouldn't come over anymore, it's so tiring for her.
                                    <br>
                                    Oohhhh my school offdays were Tuesday and fridayyy!! I can spend time with my belovedddd. I'm so happy. School seems less of a pain. But the modules still are tho. 
                                    <br>
                                    Well, eventually I reached. Door step delivery successful. Immediately I followed fen ni to her room, I was expecting to just lounge at the dining table like last time. 
                                    Then I sat on her bed. well, of course we ended up cuddling cause, heh. Dude, my girlfriend didn't wear bra, I realised that halfway whole busy cuddling her. Well I still cuddled her as per normal. 1. my girlfriend placed my hand over her T5, I'm better at not flipping when she does it, so brain managed to keep up.  2. My love seems to like it when I multi task while kissing her. So, that's good. I did make sure to check in with her and ask her permission, just incase tho.  3. Wow wow wow, then this daredevil was kissing me and removing mine. Bold move for her, and I like that she was able to do it just like that. 4. it feels weird and ticklish when she Uno it on me. I liked playing with her ear, but that's nothing new. I wonder if what i feel is the same as what fen ni feels. Why are our reactions so different?
                                    5. Dudeeee my girlfriend just straight up said "take off your hoodie" or something like that, she was mumbling. Anyways, wow. My girlfriend just, üôÄ. Then we continued to cuddle, I miss my bed.
                                    6. She also removed hers, I didn't expect that. Not that it was bad, just unexpected in a good way. Then we cuddled more, her phone kept ringing, hahaha, I felt like a hidden mistress. So fun and funny, like Jerry the mouse just hiding in the house. Except momentarily. 
                                    <br>
                                    Eventually we had to leave. Cause we had skating to go to. I didn't want to washup cause, I'm not comfortable doing so at another person's house. Or at least, not just washing up, idk how that goes about.
                                    <br>
                                    Any-o-hoo, we travelled and travelled and just weird our way there. My beloved was concerned I was hungry, very sweet of her. So we bought bread for myself to have while going up. I didn't know how to eat it, it was in a box. I took a few bites while tiny hamster was in the washroom and then we rented our skates. I helped her with her shoes again, and I'm definitely going to continue doing do even if she knows how to do it herself, cause, I love her and I want to help her with the little things when I can.
                                    <br>
                                    I enjoy skating with her, she improved a lot. I don't feel bored and slow when skating with her. I don't feel the want or need to just skate independently and quickly before coming back. This time, oddly enough 2h passed quite quickly. Well I felt bad my love fell, she said I wasn't my fault. I know it isn't, but still, I didn't want to let her fall. I really enjoy taking pictures with my love, it turned out well. Really well in fact. 
                                    <br>
                                    Ohhh and we were busy being nosy and judgy to all the guys trying to guide the girls, if not trying to skate and not fall. 1 failed date right in front of us. Hais what a disappointment guys are. We were busy just hugging even on the rink and making those people feel like 3rd wheels. Let them be envious of my capable girlfriend who can skate. Some more my girlfriend is so loving. Sucks to be them. *insert appropriate sticker
                                    <br>
                                    Surprisingly, day 3 of my period was okay, fen ni thinks I don't girl normally cause of that. 
                                    <br>
                                    We decided to eat at saizeriya (idk how to spell but yes). I felt bad again cause fen ni didn't seem to enjoy her lunch. The deserts were nice. I have a small stomach, so I realised a but late that 1 dish was enough for me.
                                    <br>
                                    I was starting to miss her already. Travelling to the mrt was a road I wished never ended. I decided to take the longer route to send her home and spend more time with her. We dozed off on the mrt after a tiring day. 
                                    <br>
                                    After that, my love was worried she would miss her stop so didn't continue resting. Hais. Once again I wish the line wouldn't end. Eventually it did reach Yishun and I waved goodbye to her. I know my love doesn't like to wave back but she saw me, and that was more than enough. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è. I miss her. 
                                    The trip home was relatively quick since I wasn't the one walking.
                                    <br>
                                    I read her letter. I really appreciate it a lot, because as much as action speaks louder than words, words aren't silent. And my beloved isn't strong in language and expressing it via words, so it is a treasured gift. Occasional but impactful. It reassures me, my place in her heart. It's something I would hold dear.

                                <p class="mb-4">In the morning
                                    I woke up at 6.30, and was Then our day is coming to an end, i couldnt bear to part but hais we had to
                                    <br>
                                    My love is so gentlemanly, she decided to take the red line and send me to yishun. I crashed on her shoulder and i did fell asleep for quite a few sec. I was worried we both would fall asleep and miss our stops tho, so i stopped sleeping hahaha 
                                    <br>
                                    I really like my cutie constantly rubbing my ears and hands when we were together. I really felt loved ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
                                    <br>
                                    Then before we reached yishun, i gave her a hand written letter (my hand writing was messy) and we kissed goodbye hurh hurh
                                    <br>
                                    I was worried when my love didnt text me she arrived home when it was 6.30 already. Turns out the message didnt send out hahaha
                                    curious if my ipad hasnt died yet
                                    <br>
                                    Surprise surprise, the zoom was still running and i saw my cutie sleeping.
                                    While waiting for her to wake up, i was figuring out what to wear cause fen ni procrastinated last night.
                                    <br>
                                    Then wait wait wait, this cute girl woke up ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è so charming even when she just woke up heh
                                    <br>
                                    But cutie took a while before she fully woke up hahaha cute piggy
                                    <br>
                                    When she left house, i sent her 3 texts at like 8.15am and she didn't read all the way until like 8.40am. I was worried her phone died and she might have lost her way. Luckily she texted back and i was relieved
                                    <br>
                                    When she was arriving (saw from her location sharing), i was so excited i was looking down my house and i see my cutie walking towards my house hehe
                                    <br>
                                    Then as i open my door, i was super excited and was smiling behind the door hehe
                                    <br>
                                    And then I brought her into my room and we cuddled. Yes, i didnt wear bra all along and i thought my girlfriend noticed from the start cause she already accidentally touch my t5 while we cuddled. My girlfriend still seemed shy everytime she touches my t5. She would feel so sorry everytime she accidentally lands there. My cutie wore a thick hoodie, so it was harder to tickle her. But she missed out her greatest weakness, her neck hehehehe. Cutie couldn't stand it that she bribed me with her t4. I kept putting her hand on my t5 until she finally stopped avoiding it. Then my cutie was busy multitasking while kissing me. I love it, alot alot. I enjoyed so much that my nose got blocked. Then fen ni eventually decides to uno on her cutie. I struggled real hard removing her bra, i tried with 1 hand but failed badly, so i used 2 hands and was hoping i got the right direction. And yup, fen ni did it. I was worried my cutie wouldn't like it and would be angry tho. I remembered my cutie saying she enjoyed skin to skin, so i asked her to take off her hoodie. But standing seems to hit differently compared to lying down. But anyways, i really enjoyed it. Then i kissed her t4 but she didnt have much reaction, so i decided to tickle it.
                                    Oh and my phone kept ringing oof, always at those moments...hmmp. After that we continued until the alarm rang. My cutie improved alot. She knows what shes doing. I was, very aroused that i couldnt control myself making weird noise. Anyways, the alarm ranged. I wished we could cuddle for the entire day but we booked ice skating hahaha
                                    <br>
                                    Oh, i prefer my cutie's bed too.
                                    <br>
                                    I was kinda guilty my hand was sweating all over and i made my girlfriend sticky, so i kept asking her to take a quick rinse. But she wasn't comfortable.
                                    <br>
                                    Otw to ice skating, i remembered my cutie didnt eat breakfast. So we decided to go grab her some finger food before we go skate. Cutie got a bread and she ate it while i used the bathroom. Then we rented the skates and cutie once again was a gentlemen and helped me with the skates. When we went to the rink, my skates felt tight and cutie didnt hesitate and immediately kneel on the ice to help me adjust my skates. I really like that she is always so thoughtful but at the same time, i was concerned that her legs might feel cold. Then went to the bench and readjusted my skates. Cutie is such a gentleman ü•∫
                                    <br>
                                    Then we skated and was busy gossiping and eavesdropping on some couples at some point. We were hugging each other too. I liked it. And then i held onto cutie's waist and we skated then fen ni jinxed herself and asked what will happen if she falls. And she fell, oopsie. My love was feeling bad about it but it really wasn't her fault ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ my cutie is getting better at moving backwards hehe. At some points, i was worried my cutie was bored, so i asked her to skate for a round on her own. Especially knowing we only left 10mins.
                                    <br>
                                    Today's skate session indeed felt like it just go pass so quickly.
                                    <br>
                                    Then we went to Sai and ordered food. My love was being so cuddly that she forgot to look at the menu, tsk tsk. But im not complaining about it, i like it.
                                    <br>
                                    As usual, we ordered too much food hah * insert sucks to be us sticker\
                                    <br>
                                    Then our day is coming to an end, i couldnt bear to part but hais we had to
                                    <br>
                                    My love is so gentlemanly, she decided to take the red line and send me to yishun. I crashed on her shoulder and i did fell asleep for quite a few sec. I was worried we both would fall asleep and miss our stops tho, so i stopped sleeping hahaha
