                                </h2>
                                <p class="mb-4">NIANN:</p>
                                <p class="mb-4">
                                    I met fen ni at yishun, she couldn't find me. idk if I should feel offended or not that till now she can't tell my silhouette. 
                                    Anyways we met and travelled to yishun. It comes natural to hold her hand immediately now.
                                    <p></p>
                                    Then we reached serangoon, I cannot remember why she keep laughing on the escalator
                                    when we enter NEX the first place was a super annoyingly bright lighted place and we looked at onesies. They were so ugly. 
                                    Fen Ni called me a kid, cause of my itchy hand playing with the toys. Fen Ni won't put on a hat.
                                    <p></p>
                                    After that we walked until our legs were tired, or mine at least. Putting my hands around her waist also became natural, 
                                    even holding her shoulder and hugging her arm. I liked that it was no longer awkward.
                                    <p></p>
                                    At about 12ish? when the sun was most likely at its peek 2 dumb crazy people decided to go rooftop. I was reading my book, then suddenly the words 
                                    reminded me if I should ask her to be my girlfriend, I wanted to do it on 14. But if I only asked on 14, I can't consider 14 a date. and 11 to 14 
                                    was just a few days different so I decided to ask her. I didn't know how to ask, Fen Ni is a very awkward and some times slow person, so anything 
                                    too indirect other than "Will you be my girlfriend?" she will pause and be super confused. Therefore being direct was the best approach, I don't 
                                    think she cannot understand that short question ah, if she cannot then no hope for her alr. 
                                    She said yes, so mission accomplished. After that, I kind of uh brain lagged. I was running on muscle memory and instinct . So yah I'm a bit fuzzy there
                                    <p></p>
                                    Well I think, uh, after that we uhhhhhh I don't know what time, but we went back to the pet shop. OH YAH the pet shop, fen ni met her friends (aka Doggos),
                                     My judgy face showed again, oops. But the dog ate so messily, and its tongue. cats for the win.  
                                    We got hungry and couldn't decide what to eat, I couldn't tell if she wanted japanese or western.
                                     then we decided fast food after many (like really many) change of choices
                                    Fen Ni decided that I'm not even MRT I'm a turtle and made the first move to kiss me. 
                                    damnnnnn short circuits. 
                                    A quote that it reminded me of: "Her lips were like the soft beauty of a delicately designed silken scarf."
                                    <p></p>
                                    Well yah, she was right. I might as well have been addicted to it, I was intoxicated that was for sure. I was giddy and light headed and left craving for more.
                                    <p></p>
                                    I was concerned about the time and if we stayed any longer, I really would've just wanted to stay there.  I was sending fen ni off to the mrt, 
                                    I stayed till her mrt left. She sat back facing me so I couldn't wave to her, I still waited for the mrt to leave nontheless.
                                    </p>

                                <p class="mb-4">FEN NI</p>
                                <p class="mb-4"><b></b></p>
                                <p class="mb-4">I met niann tsyr at yishun and i couldn't find her. I did saw someone that look like her but she said she was wearing some black leggings, 
                                    so i didnt think it was her. When i grab niann tsyr arm at yishun, she seems angry but cute. Im very clingy to niann tsyr and i cant stand 5mins not clinging onto her. 
                                    I liked when you holds my waist (except poking me) and i prefer you holding my waist more over holding hands.
                                    <p></p>
                                    When we went to the rooftop, it was hot but i liked the environment we were alone and quiet. (Only with niann tsyr i'll sit in this hot sun)
                                    <p></p>
                                    Then niann tsyr suddenly ask me to be her gf. I got too shy to reply immediately and didnt know wat to reply. 
                                    <p></p>
                                    <b>At The Library</b>
                                    we were reading together on the same chair and i enjoyed it. Then aunty suddenly say 1 metre away HAHAHA but niann tsyr decides to read to me the book and she is very charming when she explains the story to me
                                    <p></p>
                                    Since the part u asked me to be ur gf, i wanted to kiss you already, but everywhere like not appropriate ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ then we went to burger king and i seem like was watching u to eat but i was waiting for you to chew finish so i can kiss you ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ then i fed u nugget and i was actually giving u the whole piece but u didnt finish so i was having my moment of silence before i continue what niann tsyr ate halfway. Then i kissed u and ur heart boom boom heheh
                                    <p></p>
                                    I still want to spend more time with niann tsyr even tho we nth to do but it was 4pm
                                    <p></p>
                                    She sent me to mrt and it was very manly of her.
                                    <p></p>
                                    When i got into the mrt i actually turned back but i didnt see her
                                </p>
