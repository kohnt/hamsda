                                    Took me so long to convince her. Had to trade with her. I liked when she sits on me. She's not heavy. Niann tsyr busy plotting what to text my friend while she sits on me.

                                <p class="mb-4">I met fen ni at the mrt station, wow I liked her dressing. She looked handsome. In the mrt she was very close to me and it made me very very shy. I cannot function properly. 
                                    At McDonald's, I'm amazed at the burger, Idk how to eat it. So ya I split it in half otherwise it was too difficult to eat, and I was eavesdropping cause I didn't know what else to do.
                                     There wasn't anything to talk about at that time yet. Fen ni kept asking about my jacket, I didn't want to tell her it was the first day of my period because I was worried she 
                                     would cancel on me. Especially since she brought up cancelling our date yesterday night. I only told her after a while when it was too late to back out.
                                     <br>
                                    Then we went to ntuc, trying my best to find my sparkling drink, ended up looking like a 酒鬼。 Oops. We ended up not getting any snacks. Just that drink.
                                    <br>
                                    Then we took the sentosa express to well, ya, sentosa. I liked that I could keep hugging fen ni on lrt. She is a koala. Quite literally. She seems to love to plunge her face against mine.
                                    <br>
                                    When we reached we took the tram, wow how much I don't like the sun. So we got off otherwise we'll be scooted off to idk where. And damn the sun. the moment we reach we sat at the 
                                    tentage from last Saturday's event. And fen ni loses her back bone, and is always leaning against me. Very soon, the kisses started alr. Not that I didn't like it.  Of course I love receiving 
                                    kisses from my girlfriend. I felt really lucky and at bliss. 
                                    <br>
                                    Afterwards fen ni sat back facing me and then sat facing me as we continued to PDA, I was worried we PDA too much. But oh well, I'm addicted to my girlfriend, can't help it.
                                    <br>
                                    I suddenly remembered that UAB and it was fun to be mean to others especially when you mean it. But fen ni wouldn't on her phone for me. Give and take, she wants me to sit on 
                                    her before she unlocks it for me. Oh well, I had to, I ended thinking about it and decided not to send cause it may affect fen ni, so after she graduates.
                                    <br>
                                    Mmm then we took pictures and turned out pretty decent. I really liked it, we look cute/good tgt. Happy happy.
                                    <br>
                                    We washed up kinda, still getting used to seeing my girlfriend in the same washroom as me. But it's very convenient at times, today being one of them.
                                    Then we took the tram back and we enjoy the breeze.
                                    <br>
                                    Then otw back and dinner, I'm alr going to miss fen ni even when she was beside me.
                                    <br>
                                    I don't want this day to end, it can end, I don't want to part with her.
                                </p>
