                                <b class="mb-4">NIANN</b>
                                <p class="mb-4">I wore shorts. 
                                    Very difficult decision to make, but before I could change out I checked the time and fen ni would have arrived soon. 
                                    So I just went with it and met you at the bus stop. But still a little too slow. 
                                    Then I was self conscious so I was trying to stand behind you but you were a worm twisting left and right. 
                                    Mmm then in the lift you alr started to disturb me. I forgot what you did in details tho.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I was so hesitant to pick up the guitar. I have 0 confidence. girl here didn't even know any chords anymore, it went badly in my opinion.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Then yay I get to put down the guitar, even twinkle twinkle was hard oof. We cuddled and cuddled and cuddled more. I really like hugging fen ni.
                                    Oh ya, her kissing got wayy better today. 
                                    There was one point she kept tickling me till I wanted to bite, at that point, I think I just went for her shoulders first. The ear and neck was tempting. 
                                    Now I can gently bite fen ni's ear and she is okay with it.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I manage to kiss her neck too, but she has no reaction, nvm but I think she likes it when I do to her ear. We monitored heart rate too, mine keep 
                                    fluctuating around her. Her's quite consistent. Oof
                                    No hand phones were lost today.  Yayyy
                                    She has this look when we cuddle or after we kiss, so seductive and very alluring.
                                    Oh but I really do like arranging a pillow underneath her head, idk why. 
                                    Oh oh oh and there was the part after lunch, I yeeted her on to the bed. So fun. I wanted to do again.
                                    After lunch was about 2. I didn't look forward to having her go home.
                                    We cuddled a little more, this time she was willing to go under a blanket, but I was constantly worried she feels warm underneath. I wish I could fall 
                                    asleep with her in my arms.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I don't know how we got to that point, but fen ni put my hands on her boob with shirt between. Then asked me compare whose smaller, idw to say so I just 
                                    let her decide on her own. Then once again idk how we got there. Oh ya I was grabbing her waist area. Fen ni decides to put my hand underneath her shirt. 
                                    And land mines were going off in my head, how do I react.  It's like a huge 
                                    "Infringement of privacy" Warning there. Idk how to react. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Uh she did I again, I stun again.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Uh anyways after multiples server failures and brain crashes, I think we got back to cuddling normally. She was suppose to leave earlier but I whined and 
                                    said I'd miss her. I didnt really want her to stay tho, cause she might blame me if she got caught going out of the house. I just wanted to whine. 
                                    I'm glad she stayed and didn't blame me. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    I was contemplating passing her 2 jacket, but she might find me too protective or extra. I also wanted her to fill up her bottle with hot water so it 
                                    can at least warm her up a little if the bus was cold but I didn't insisted. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    I felt bad when it was raining heavily and she had to go because it's partially my fault. But it was fun, except that she had to go home with her clothes partially wet.
                                    I was really concerned about her health, body temperature, cram and comfort level.
                                    I miss her alr.
                                    </p>


                                
                                <p class="mb-4">FEN NI</p>
                                <p class="mb-4">When i reached, my girlfriend refuse to let me look at her all the way till she played the guitar.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Niann tsyr was being a cutie rebel refusing to play. But she can actually play guitar, just shy 🥰
                                    <br><br>
                                    Then after that we started cuddling and stuff. My girlfriend is extra kissing demon today. She was so sweet all the time, worried that i would feel uncomfortable or bang my head.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Niann tsyr still gets a little violent when i tickle her neck. But heh fen ni is a troll so she shall have fun. I enjoyed kissing her neck and ear alot alot. 
                                    I really really really enjoyed cuddling hugging and kissing my girlfriend but time went by so fast :c
                                    <br><br>
                                    I like it when my girlfriend lays on top of me. But she was so conscious of her weight i could feel her hand shaking to not lay on me fully. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    My girlfriend attempted her mission and she kinda succeeded in a way, she manage to tempt me kiss her. I really like and enjoy the feeling when she 
                                    bite and kiss my ears gently. I could fall asleep. And yes, i think my neck abit 没有知觉. Oh and i noticed my right side tends to be more sensitive
                                    <br><br>
                                    At one point, i started to disturb niann tsyr. I placed her hand on my boobs. My cutie looks so shy, having existential crisis
                                    <br><br>
                                    When its 3pm, i was going to leave but my cutie was so cute I couldn't bear to leave either, so i stayed for another 30mins. My cute girlfriend didn't wanna let me set an alarm.
                                    <br><br>
                                    We continued cuddling hugging and kissing and my alarm ranged again. My cutie seemed so sad when i had to go hurh hurh. But no choice, i had to go.
                                    <br><br>
                                    When we went out, nai nai was concerned about the weather so we went back in. My cutie's face immediately lit up. But she was being a gentleman 
                                    and concerned that I would reach home late. ❤️ so we decided to just leave
                                    <br><br>
                                    My gentleman girlfriend gave me her jacket and insisted she send me to the bus stop. She was so gentlemanly, she held the umbrella towards me and disregard herself.
                                    <br><br>
                                    When my bus came, hurh hurh. Withdrawal symptoms.
