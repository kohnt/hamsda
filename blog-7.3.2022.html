                                <p class="mb-4">FEN NI</p>
                                <p class="mb-4">When I arrived, niann tsyr gave me her hand and i hugged it, i like the warmth. Then i went in her room while she lectures her brother üòÇüòÇ I sat on the chair and used my phone.
                                    Niann Tsyr was doing her slides and i lied on her thigh for a few sec while she clicking her slides. Then she decided to keep her laptop (I think she might have thought i would feel bored so she wants to entertain me? If thats wat she thinks then i liked it, im touched)
                                    <p></p>
                                    I started teasing niann tsyr, Niann Tsyr very cute and needs many moments of silence. I didn't have intention to kiss niann tsyr at all, i was having fun teasing her ü•∞ Then I lost my phone, awks HAHAHA her nai nai was laughing like she've seen everything. 
                                    Then niann tsyr went for her meeting, she attacked my neck, she managed to do wat i did to her. I liked it. When niann tsyr's turn to make me shy, i did feel something, but it was too short so not much.
                                    <p></p>
                                    When i was going to leave, i dont want to leave. I want to stay with niann tsyr foreverr üêΩ
                                    </p>

                                <p class="mb-4">NIANN</p>
                                <p class="mb-4"><b></b></p>
                                <p class="mb-4">I wanted to do my slides, but there were very little to be done becuase i only left with pictures which i didn't want to take. and fen ni was just using her phone and I don't want her to be bored
                                    So I decided to hug her and snuggle time, also cause I wanted to. (I blame it on my love language, heh)
                                    <p></p>
                                    I wanted to play the guitar because i didn't know what else to do, but lazy teacher fen ni seems like she wanted cuddle time instead of guitar time. So fineeeeeeeeee! 
                                    <p></p>
                                    Idk how miss tiny hamster decided to go crazy and started attacking my neck.
                                    But ya she did and it didn't stop, my brain having tsunami inside alr and she still won't spare me. 
                                    Even my heart is betraying me.
                                    <p></p>
                                    and I'm very self cautious about my weight so when she asked me to lie on her, that was a big no.
                                    I just feel self cautious I'm heavy, even if general standard I'm not, I don't think I want her to carry me cause why would I want that???
                                    <p></p>
                                    I CAN"T BLIEVE SHE CAN LOSE HER PHONE LIKE THAT! WE busy hunting for the damn phone. And she dropped by teddies also. That damn phone decided to commit die. 
                                    <p></p>
                                    I'm glad fen ni was able to take the pizza i was worried about the tomato. Then I had my meeting. And I didn't want her to just sit there so I decided to go on the bed where I can still entertain her while having my meeting.
                                    <p></p>
                                    I didn't want fen ni to leave, I wanted to spend more time with her. So I was very disappointed when she did have to leave and suddenly my energy drain kick in. Which I feel bad because I was still with her. 
                                    <p> </p>
                                    For the 2nd time she didn't wave back at me on the bus.
                                </p>
